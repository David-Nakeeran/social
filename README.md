## Reflection

Unfortunately I didn't have time this weekend to work on the project.

Learning Typescript was pretty hard, if you can recommend any tutorials that would be great!

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

- Junction tables, followers

What was difficult about the tasks you didn't complete?

- I'm wondering if I could have moved my db select queries into the actions file, but then I think that is more for form submission and button clicks. Maybe the API way Manny showed might have been a good way. I will have to look into that after the course.

- Not sure I like radix that much, maybe I need to use it a bit more.

- Timeline polling would be a nice touch but didn't have time.

- I would love to learn about websockets, is this compatible with vercel though? As I read it isn't? If you have any tutorials or articles please send them my way, thank you!

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
